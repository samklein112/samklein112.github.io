collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-09-02-schema-theory-review
excerpt: "The literature review explores the application and implications of Schema Theory in diverse fields such as personal growth, cross-cultural communication, and social media. Schema Theory, a branch of cognitive psychology, suggests that individuals possess mental structures guiding their perception, processing, interpretation, and recall of information. The review highlights how schemas continue to evolve throughout an individual's life, influencing their development. It also discusses the role of cultural schemas in bridging communication gaps between different cultures. In the social media context, the review introduces the concept of 'social media platform schema' which impacts how users interpret and share information on different platforms. The review concludes by suggesting further research on the limitations of Schema Theory, including its potential to lead to cognitive biases and stereotyping."
